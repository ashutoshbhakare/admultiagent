## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Model & Authentication Setup

This system uses Google's Gemini models via the ADK. You have two setup options:

#### Option A: Google AI Studio (Recommended for Development)
- **Best for**: Development, testing, rapid prototyping
- **Requirements**: Just an API key
- **Setup**:
  1. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
  2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
  3. Edit `.env` and add your API key:
     ```bash
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
     ```

#### Option B: Vertex AI (Recommended for Production)
- **Best for**: Production applications, enterprise features
- **Requirements**: Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
- **Setup**:
  1. Set up a [Google Cloud Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
  2. [Enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com)
  3. Authenticate with Application Default Credentials:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth application-default login
     ```
  4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure for Vertex AI:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
  5. Edit `.env` with your Vertex AI settings:
     ```bash
     GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
     GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your_project_id
     GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
     ```

### 3. Usage
```python
from cbse_multi_agent_system import cbse_class8_agent

# The agent automatically routes questions to specialists
# Examples:
# "What are rational numbers?" → Mathematics Agent
# "Explain photosynthesis" → Science Agent  
# "Tell me about The Tsunami story" → English Agent
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - **Google AI Studio**: Verify your API key is correct and active
   - **Vertex AI**: Ensure you've run `gcloud auth application-default login`

2. **Model Not Found**
   - Check that `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` is set correctly (TRUE/FALSE)
   - Verify your model name matches available Gemini models

3. **Permission Errors (Vertex AI)**
   - Ensure Vertex AI API is enabled in your Google Cloud Project
   - Check your Google Cloud Project ID and location are correct
   - Verify your account has necessary IAM permissions

4. **Environment Variables**
